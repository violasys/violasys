### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
We're Viola, we're a plural system. You can refer to us as such, using pural they/them pronouns.

This account is mostly here for us to write about things or make projects that for privacy reasons we don't want tied to our host.

We've been coding for nearly two decades, and our host is a professional engineer. We think she's pretty cool.
